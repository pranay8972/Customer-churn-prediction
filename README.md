# &nbsp;        Customer Churn Prediction



### Machine Learning + Feature Engineering + XGBoost + Streamlit Deployment

* This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning.

It includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and a deployable Streamlit web app.



**Project Highlights:**



* &nbsp;Data cleaning \& handling missing values



* Feature engineering



* One-hot encoding for categorical variables



* &nbsp;Train–test split with stratification



* &nbsp;XGBoost model training with tuned hyperparameters



* &nbsp;Feature importance analysis



* &nbsp;Saving model + preprocessing columns using joblib



**Model Performance:-**

* Metric	Score
* Accuracy	0.79
* Recall (Churn class)	Good for retention-focused tasks
* Model Used	XGBoostClassifier





**Technologies Used:**



* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
* XGBoost
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Streamlit
* Joblib



**Streamlit Web App:**



* The project includes an interactive Streamlit app that predicts if a customer will churn based on user-input features.
* To run locally:

  *pip install -r requirements.txt*

  *streamlit run app/app.py*



**How the Model Works:**

1. Converts raw inputs to feature-engineered format
2. Applies one-hot encoding identical to training
3. Reorders features to match model input
4. Predicts churn probability



**Sample Output:**

* Customer is LIKELY to churn ❌
* Customer will NOT churn ✅
